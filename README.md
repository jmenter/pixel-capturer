# pixel-capturer
A Mac utility for pixel-perfect monitoring of av devices

The goal of this project is to allow the user to select video input devices (such as USB/HDMI capture dongles) and control the pixel dimensions / codec / frame rate of the AVCaptureDevice, and also the scaling of the video data in the window.

Ultimately, presenting digital video data from retro devices (GameCube, classic Mac OS, etc.) using integer scaling algorithms (which preserve hard pixel edges) is what we're after.
